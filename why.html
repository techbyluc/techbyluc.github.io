            <h2>Why I prefer dogs over cats</h2>
            <p>Dogs are better than cats because they can do much more and are a lot more loving. Dogs are a lot more loyal than cats are, even going as far as following you everywhere and wanting to do everything with you while cats just enjoy time to themselves. You can teach dogs to do some many things as well such as doing tricks and help you out with every day activities. Dogs are also commonly used as emotional support animals, service animals, and are the most popular pet in the world.</p>
